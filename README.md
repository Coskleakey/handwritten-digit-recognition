# handwritten-digit-recognition
Search instead for handwirtten recognition in python description  The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value. 
# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project uses a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset to identify digits. It includes:
- Training script (`fast.py`)
- GUI for drawing your own digits (`draw_and_predict.py`)
